# The Science Behind French-Style Premium Spinach Puree

## **Introduction**

At Fala, we are reimagining how spinach is processed — not as a series of mechanical steps, but as a **precision-controlled scientific process**.  
 Our goal is to create **French-style spinach puree** that delivers consistent color, texture, aroma, and nutrition, batch after batch.

This is achieved by embedding **measurement, control, and intelligence** at every step — from sorting to freezing.  
 We call this philosophy **“Puree Intelligence”** — the fusion of food craftsmanship and data technology.

*Every parameter we capture — from leaf size, blanch temperature to speed of a Machine — becomes a datapoint in our journey toward pure perfection.*

## 

## **Process Overview: The Data-Driven Puree Flow**

The spinach puree process is not just linear — it’s **data-linked**.  
 Each step provides inputs that are measured, logged, and optimized through our digital system i.e **Puree Agent**.

**Process Flow:**

1. Sorting  
2. Cleaning  
3. Blanching  
4. Cooling  
5. Pulverizing  
6. Packing & Freezing

Each step communicates with the ***Puree Agent*** — which collects sensor data, analyzes batch trends, and provides feedback to ensure the next batch is even better.
